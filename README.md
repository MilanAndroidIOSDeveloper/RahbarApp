# Rahber's App Prototype and Algorithmic Solution

This repository contains the prototype development and algorithmic solution for Rahber's mobile application.

Below is a detailed overview of the implementation, including features, design decisions, and algorithmic enhancements.

# Prototype Development

# Features Implemented:

# Course List:

Displayed a dynamic list of available courses.

Included key details such as the title, a brief description, and the instructor's name.

Implemented using RecyclerView in Android.

# Course Detail View:

Created a detailed course page with a full description, video modules, and an enrolment button.

Utilized a separate activity/fragment for the detailed view.

Designed an intuitive UI/UX for easy navigation.

# Enrolment Feature:

Implemented functionality to allow users to enrol in courses.

Added courses to the user's profile for easy access.

Handled enrolment logic using Firebase Firestore for data storage.

# Technical Details:

Language: Kotlin

Development Tools: Android Studio

Mock Service Layer: Utilized mock data for simulating data fetching.

Design Principles: Followed Material Design guidelines for a clean and intuitive UI/UX.

Data Fetching: Used ViewModel and LiveData for fetching and observing course data.

# Running the App:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open the project in Android Studio.

Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

# Algorithmic Challenge

# Algorithm Implemented:

# Personalized Course Recommendations:

Designed an algorithm to search courses for users based on their interests, previous enrolments, and course popularity.

Implemented a collaborative filtering algorithm to analyze user behaviour and preferences.

Integrated recommendation engine with Firestore database for real-time updates.

# Efficiency and Optimization:

# Data Synchronization:

Implemented a solution for synchronizing course data efficiently between the server and client app.

Utilized Firebase Realtime Database for seamless data synchronization.

Implemented caching mechanism to minimize data usage and ensure smooth operation in low-bandwidth scenarios.

# Future Improvements:

Implement server-side recommendations for more accurate and personalized course suggestions.

Optimize data synchronization further for improved performance in low-bandwidth environments.

Enhance UI/UX based on user feedback and usability testing.
